# HTML Compressor
Compresses html using HTML Compressor.
Javascript and css also minified with YUI-Compressor

## Installation
Use package control <http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control> and search for HTML Compressor

## Getting started
Chose HTML Compressor as a build system. Build file when ready.

The plugin generates a new file with the extension '.min.html'

## Update
Added two more separate build systems for CSS and JS.

## Note
To preserve comments from removing after minification use '!'.
For example: /*! Comment */
